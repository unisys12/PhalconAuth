PhalconAuth
===========

Authentication Library for PhalconPHP Framework

*PhalconAuth* is a very simple, bear bones user authentication library I wrote for use in a [Phalcon](phalconphp.com) project. This repo is going to be used as an experimental version, of sorts, so that I can play around with teaching myself testing principles (outside of a project) and learning how to properly put together a package for release through [Composer](getcomposer.org).

###What will PhalconAuth do?
Use of this repo might cause extreme illness, frustration, hair loss, blurred vision, dizziness, insane thoughts, puppies to cry and unicorns to die. You have been warned that this is a repo that is a work in progress! Once this project is further along and ready for proper use, this readme will be updated.
